Example web app for a front end job application.

## To rebuild the app:

### 1. Delete 'distr' folder

### 2. Build the app:

Install devDependencies:

```
npm install
```

Build the app:

```
gulp build
```
### 3. Done

Reload the browser

## Serving changes:

The browser will auto-reload, sass files will auto-compile, and js will auto-transpile to es5 on change.

```
gulp serve
```
or just
```
gulp
```
since 'serve' is set as a default gulp task.
